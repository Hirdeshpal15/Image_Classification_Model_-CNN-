# 🖼️ Image Classification Using CNN | Deep Learning with Keras & TensorFlow

This image classification project repository, where I explore how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can empower machines to see and recognize patterns in visual data.

This project demonstrates my ability to design, train, and evaluate a custom CNN for classifying images using popular datasets. It was developed as part of my practical coursework and self-learning.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an end-to-end pipeline that:
- Preprocesses image data for training,
- Designs a CNN from scratch using Keras,
- Trains the model efficiently with proper regularization,
- Evaluates model performance on unseen data,
- Visualizes metrics and interprets learning curves.
